# PCB-Design-Project
This project designs a PCB for a complete signal-conditioning module that includes a bandpass filter, amplifier, and clipper. The circuit prepares raw sensor signals by filtering noise, boosting amplitude, and limiting peaks, enabling clean and stable input for further processing.
